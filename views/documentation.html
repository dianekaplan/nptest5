<h4>Inspiration: </h4>
<p>At least once a year I find myself travelling with no  
access to a gym and without a good/safe place to run, so I'm scrambling to improvise
some kind of workout.  It's usually the same boring mix of pushups, 
situps, lunges, and dips off the bed. Working out with <a href="http://november-project.com/" target="_blank">November Project</a>
has shown me that you can get a solid workout without any equipment at all, especially
if you have a little space, common stuff you find in the park, and best of all a willing buddy. 
With this tool, no more scrambling: a new workout is a couple clicks away. </p>

<h4>Using this tool: </h4>
<p><a href="index.php">Make a new workout:</a> pick what resources you have available.  
Leave the bottom-section defaults for a 15-20 minute workout, or play with the number
of different sets, and exercises per set. Hit submit, and you're off!  
On your workout page, hover over the exercise name to see a description, or 
click thumbnail to see what it looks like. Everybody's ability is different.  We give suggested timing 
and counts just as a placeholder- choose whatever feels like the right challenge for you. </p>

<p>Working out on your own, cycle through the exercises at your challenge level (1 minute each, 20 each, etc)
continuing for a 4 minute set, 8 minute set, enough to get comfortable with the exercises and really feel it!  
If you're working out with a partner, you'll get pairs of exercises- sometimes working together and switching in 
the middle, and sometimes one partner travelling to a point and back, while the other does a different 
exercise on the spot (cheering partner to come back so they can switch!). You'll agree on the distance/time/duration 
together (e.g. to that tree and back) for what challenges you. </p>

<p>If you like workout you got, you can print it, facebook-share it, or email 
it to yourself.  If you you want something different, click the links at the bottom
of the page: get a new workout using the same stuff you selected before,
or search fresh to make a change. You can also browse the exercise 
list to see what we've got in there so far, 
and <a href="mailto:dianekaplan@gmail.com?Subject=Workout%20maker%20feedback">email me</a> 
if you have questions or ideas to make the tool better!</p>

Enjoy! <br/>
